# Your Article Title Here

**Lead paragraph:** Start with a clear, concise introduction that directly addresses the topic and answers the primary question. This paragraph should tell the reader exactly what they'll learn and why it matters to them. Aim for 2-3 sentences that hook the reader immediately.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn [specific outcomes the reader will achieve]. We'll cover [main topic 1], [main topic 2], and [main topic 3], providing actionable steps to [desired result]. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of [final takeaway].

## Main Section 1: Descriptive Heading

Start with context and background information. Use clear, simple language that non-experts can understand. Each section should have a clear purpose and flow logically from the previous section.

Use real-world examples to illustrate your points:

**Example:** When insurance companies evaluate total loss claims, they typically follow a specific formula to determine if repair costs exceed the vehicle's actual cash value (ACV).

### Subsection 1.1: Break Down Complex Topics

Break down complex topics into digestible chunks. Use subheadings to organize information and improve scannability.

Key points to remember:

- Bullet point 1: Keep it concise and actionable
- Bullet point 2: Use specific data when possible
- Bullet point 3: Focus on practical implications

### Subsection 1.2: Use Data and Examples

Include statistics, formulas, or calculations where relevant:

```
Formula Example:
Total Loss Threshold = Repair Cost > (ACV - Salvage Value)

Example Calculation:
- Vehicle ACV: $25,000
- Salvage Value: $3,000
- Total Loss Threshold: $22,000
- If repair costs exceed $22,000 → Total Loss
```

## Main Section 2: Continue Building Context

Each section should build on the previous one, creating a logical progression of information. Address common questions and concerns your audience has.

### Using Tables for Comparisons

Tables are excellent for comparing options or presenting structured data:

| Mileage   | High            | $0.05-0.10 per mile |
| Condition | High            | ±10-20%             |
| Location  | Medium          | ±5-15%              |
| Features  | Low-Medium      | ±3-8%               |
