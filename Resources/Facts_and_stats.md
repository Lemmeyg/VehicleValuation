## The Appraisal Process at a Glance

- Average resolution: **30–90 days** from initiation to revised settlement *(AppraiseItNow; InjuryLawyers.com, 2025)*.  
- Many insurers increase offers once an independent appraisal request is filed, to avoid formal adjudication *(AppraiseItNow, 2025)*.  
- Appraisal results are **binding**, but do not require a lawsuit. They can also enhance leverage in mediation or legal processes *(InjuryLawyers.com, 2025)*.

- **Decreasing vehicle values:** Average used vehicle value dropped to **$13,445**, creating greater insurer–policyholder valuation gaps *(CCC Intelligent Solutions, 2025)*.  
- **Older vehicles at risk:** Over 70% of cars aged seven years or older are declared total losses *(CCC Intelligent Solutions, 2025)*.  
- **Appraisal gains growing:** Appraisal-based disputes now account for roughly **12%** of all total loss negotiations — up from 7% in 2020 *(Roundtables P&C Trend Report, 2025)*.
