## The Appraisal Process at a Glance

- The **appraisal clause** in most auto insurance policies grants the right to a neutral appraiser if you dispute your claim value.  
- Average resolution: **30–90 days** from initiation to revised settlement *(AppraiseItNow; InjuryLawyers.com, 2025)*.  
- Many insurers increase offers once an independent appraisal request is filed, to avoid formal adjudication *(AppraiseItNow, 2025)*.  
- Appraisal results are **binding**, but do not require a lawsuit. They can also enhance leverage in mediation or legal processes *(InjuryLawyers.com, 2025)*.

## Industry Data Supporting Independent Appraisal Use

- **Rising total loss frequency:** 22.6% of all auto claims now result in total loss as of April 2025 — up 0.9 points year-over-year *(CCC Intelligent Solutions, Q2 2025)*.  
- **Decreasing vehicle values:** Average used vehicle value dropped to **$13,445**, creating greater insurer–policyholder valuation gaps *(CCC Intelligent Solutions, 2025)*.  
- **Older vehicles at risk:** Over 70% of cars aged seven years or older are declared total losses *(CCC Intelligent Solutions, 2025)*.  
- **Appraisal gains growing:** Appraisal-based disputes now account for roughly **12%** of all total loss negotiations — up from 7% in 2020 *(Roundtables P&C Trend Report, 2025)*.  

These developments mean more owners have reason to question initial offers and pursue accurate, data-driven assessments.

## Strategic Takeaways for Vehicle Owners

- Vehicle owners who seek an independent valuation routinely secure **20–70% higher payouts**.  
- Engaging an appraiser early can prompt insurers to improve offers **before** formal proceedings.  
- The process is cost-effective, faster than litigation, and validated by multiple independent studies.  
- Undervaluation remains a consistent trend with carrier-appointed adjusters — independent verification restores fairness in settlements.
