## Information We Collect

### Account Information

- **Name** (first and last)
- **Email address**
- **Password** (stored securely using industry-standard encryption)

### Vehicle Information

## How We Protect Your Information

We take the security of your personal information seriously and implement multiple layers of protection:

### Data Storage
- All user data is stored on **Supabase**, a secure cloud database platform
- Data is transmitted using industry-standard SSL/TLS encryption

### Access Controls
- We implement strict access controls limiting who can view or handle sensitive data
- Only authorized personnel have access to user information on a need-to-know basis
- VIN data receives additional protection due to its sensitive nature

### Security Measures
- Regular security assessments and updates
- Password protection using secure hashing algorithms
- Monitoring for unauthorized access attempts

### VIN Data Protection
Because VINs are considered sensitive personal identifiers that can be linked to vehicle ownership:
- We limit VIN data access to essential operations only
- VINs are only shared with trusted API providers necessary for generating your reports
- We do not sell or share VIN data with third parties for marketing purposes

**Please note:** While we implement robust security measures, no method of electronic storage or internet transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security but continuously work to protect your information.
